However, they often rely on tools -\\nlike books, Google Search, or a calculator - to supplement their prior knowledge before\\narriving at a conclusion. Just like humans, Generative AI models can be trained to use tools to\\naccess real-time information or suggest a real-world action. For example, a model can\\nleverage a database retrieval tool to access specific information, like a customer's purchase\\nhistory, so it can generate tailored shopping recommendations. Alternatively, based on a\\nuser's query, a model can make various API calls to send an email response to a colleague or\\ncomplete a financial transaction on your behalf. To do so, the model must not only have\\naccess to a set of external tools, it needs the ability to plan and execute any task in a self-\\ndirected fashion. This combination of reasoning, logic, and access to external information\\nthat are all connected to a Generative AI model invokes the concept of an agent, or a\\nprogram that extends beyond the standalone capabilities of a Generative AI model.

Agents are autonomous and can act independently of human intervention,\\nespecially when provided with proper goals or objectives they are meant to achieve. Agents\\ncan also be proactive in their approach to reaching their goals. Even in the absence of explicit\\ninstruction sets from a human, an agent can reason about what it should do next to achieve\\nits ultimate goal. While the notion of agents in AI is quite general and powerful, this\\nwhitepaper focuses on the specific types of agents that Generative AI models are capable of\\nbuilding at the time of publication.\\nIn order to understand the inner workings of an agent, let’s first introduce the foundational\\ncomponents that drive the agent’s behavior, actions, and decision making. The combination\\nof these components can be described as a cognitive architecture, and there are many\\nsuch architectures that can be achieved by the mixing and matching of these components.\\nFocusing on the core functionalities, there are three essential components in an agent’s\\ncognitive architecture as shown in Figure 1.'),\n",

General agent architecture and components\\nThe model\\nIn the scope of an agent, a model refers to the language model (LM) that will be utilized as\\nthe centralized decision maker for agent processes. The model used by an agent can be one\\nor multiple LM’s of any size (small / large) that are capable of following instruction based\\nreasoning and logic frameworks, like ReAct, Chain-of-Thought, or Tree-of-Thoughts. Models\\ncan be general purpose, multimodal or fine-tuned based on the needs of your specific agent\\narchitecture. For best production results, you should leverage a model that best fits your\\ndesired end application and, ideally, has been trained on data signatures associated with the\\ntools that you plan to use in the cognitive architecture. It’s important to note that the model is\\ntypically not trained with the specific configuration settings (i.e. tool choices, orchestration/\\nreasoning setup) of the agent. However, it’s possible to further refine the model for the\\nagent’s tasks by providing it with examples that showcase the agent’s capabilities, including\\ninstances of the agent using specific tools or reasoning steps in various contexts.'),\n",

In general, this loop will continue until an agent has reached its goal or a\\nstopping point. The complexity of the orchestration layer can vary greatly depending on the\\nagent and task it’s performing. Some loops can be simple calculations with decision rules,\\nwhile others may contain chained logic, involve additional machine learning algorithms, or\\nimplement other probabilistic reasoning techniques. We’ll discuss more about the detailed\\nimplementation of the agent orchestration layers in the cognitive architecture section.\\nFoundational models, despite their impressive text and image generation, remain constrained\\nby their inability to interact with the outside world. Tools bridge this gap, empowering agents\\nto interact with external data and services while unlocking a wider range of actions beyond\\nthat of the underlying model alone. Tools can take a variety of forms and have varying\\ndepths of complexity, but typically align with common web API methods like GET, POST,\\nPATCH, and DELETE. For example, a tool could update customer information in a database\\nor fetch weather data to influence a travel recommendation that the agent is providing to\\nthe user. With tools, agents can access and process real-world information. This empowers\\nthem to support more specialized systems like retrieval augmented generation (RAG),\\nwhich significantly extends an agent’s capabilities beyond what the foundational model can\\nachieve on its own. We’ll discuss tools in more detail below, but the most important thing\\nto understand is that tools bridge the gap between the agent’s internal capabilities and the\\nexternal world, unlocking a broader range of possibilities.'),\n",

In the next section, we’ll dive into the various ways agents connect\\nwith fresh data. \\nWhile they go by many names, tools are what create a link between our foundational models\\nand the outside world. This link to external systems and data allows our agent to perform a\\nwider variety of tasks and do so with more accuracy and reliability. For instance, tools can\\nenable agents to adjust smart home settings, update calendars, fetch user information from\\na database, or send emails based on a specific set of instructions.\\nWhile language models excel at processing information, they lack the ability to directly\\nperceive and influence the real world. This limits their usefulness in situations requiring\\ninteraction with external systems or data. This means that, in a sense, a language model\\nis only as good as what it has learned from its training data. But regardless of how much\\ndata we throw at a model, they still lack the fundamental ability to interact with the outside\\nworld. So how can we empower our models to have real-time, context-aware interaction with\\nexternal systems? Functions, Extensions, Data Stores and Plugins are all ways to provide this\\ncritical capability to the model.\\nAs of the date of this publication, there are three primary tool types that Google models are\\nable to interact with: Extensions, Functions, and Data Stores.

While general training\\nhelps models develop this skill, real-world scenarios often require knowledge beyond the\\ntraining data. Imagine this as the difference between basic cooking skills and mastering\\na specific cuisine. Both require foundational cooking knowledge, but the latter demands\\ntargeted learning for more nuanced results.\\nTo provide additional insights on each of the targeted learning approaches, let’s revisit our\\ncooking analogy.\\nTo help the model gain access to this type of specific knowledge, several approaches exist:\\n• In-context learning: This method provides a generalized model with a prompt, tools, and \\nfew-shot examples at inference time which allows it to learn ‘on the fly' how and when to \\nuse those tools for a specific task. The ReAct framework is an example of this approach in \\nnatural language.\\n• Retrieval-based in-context learning: This technique dynamically populates the model \\nprompt with the most relevant information, tools, and associated examples by retrieving \\nthem from external memory. An example of this would be the ‘Example Store’ in Vertex AI \\nextensions or the data stores RAG based architecture mentioned previously.\\n• Fine-tuning based learning: This method involves training a model using a larger dataset \\nof specific examples prior to inference. This helps the model understand when and how to \\napply certain tools prior to receiving any user queries.\"),\n",

Some key takeaways from this whitepaper include:\\n1. Agents extend the capabilities of language models by leveraging tools to access real-\\nThe future of agents holds exciting advancements and we’ve only begun to scratch the\\nsurface of what is possible. As tools become more sophisticated and reasoning capabilities\\nare enhanced, agents will be empowered to solve increasingly complex problems.\\nFurthermore, the strategic approach of ‘agent chaining’ will continue to gain momentum. By \\ntime information, suggest real-world actions, and plan and execute complex tasks \\nautonomously. agents can leverage one or more language models to decide when and \\nhow to transition through states and use external tools to complete any number of \\ncomplex tasks that would be difficult or impossible for the model to complete on its own.\\n2. At the heart of an agent’s operation is the orchestration layer, a cognitive architecture that \\nstructures reasoning, planning, decision-making and guides its actions. Various reasoning \\ntechniques such as ReAct, Chain-of-Thought, and Tree-of-Thoughts, provide a framework \\nfor the orchestration layer to take in information, perform internal reasoning, and generate \\ninformed decisions or responses. \\n3. Tools, such as Extensions, Functions, and Data Stores, serve as the keys to the outside \\nworld for agents, allowing them to interact with external systems and access knowledge \\nbeyond their training data. Extensions provide a bridge between agents and external APIs, \\nenabling the execution of API calls and retrieval of real-time information. functions provide \\na more nuanced control for the developer through the division of labor, allowing agents \\nto generate Function parameters which can be executed client-side. Data Stores provide \\nagents with access to structured or unstructured data, enabling data-driven applications.'),\n",
